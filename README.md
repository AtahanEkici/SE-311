### 2) Abstract Factory: In Sensor.java class for creating sensor and sub-sensor types.(Pollution, Congestion,Temp etc.)

### 3) Iterator: In Sensor.java class

### 4) Observer: Used this Pattern in both Apartments and Poles Notification

### 5) Visitor: Used this pattern for Resetting the Sensors

### 6) Composite: Since all the Objects that are attached to JFrame
